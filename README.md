# Tribal Scale Interview Assignment

React interview assignment for Tribal Scale

## Getting started

### Setting up the assignment

* Move into your projects directory: `cd ~/YOUR_PROJECTS_DIRECTORY`
* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jvjruiz/tribal-scale.git`
* Move into the project directory: `cd tribal-scale`
* Install the dependencies: `npm install`
* Run project: `npm run dev`
* Open up browser and go to: `localhost:8080`
* To run tests: `npm test`

### Overall Appraoch
My overall approach was broken down into steps:
1. Make actions and reducer to get data from the API and store in state
2. Display data onto DOM
3. Implement search and filter features with accompanying components and actions
4. Implement modal with accompanying component and actions
5. Style

### Features Complete
I finished all of the basic features and some basic tests for the components, actions and reducer

###If I had more time...
* I would have liked to work on the automation UI testing and deploying to a cloud infrastracture, along with more robust tests for the components
* If I were to add more robust features, I would include a way for the use to choose how many results they would get back from a search query, the ability to generate random lists based on different 'seed' parameters, and the ability to export the data into a .json file to be used with other projects if the user liked the particular list.
